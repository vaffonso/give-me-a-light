# Give Me A Light

Game to discover the word based on the sequence that each letter lights up.

## TODO

- To replace wordFetcher by some API. Some [available APIs]<https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#dictionaries>
  - For now using mocked words
- Good topic to put in practice [inversion of control](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control)
- Hard to identify repeated letter
- Update char placeholders when word changes

- Another reactjs game as reference - [whac-a-mole](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/get-started-whac-a-mole-react-game/)
